In JavaScript, every object has an internal property called \[\[Prototype\]\] (denoted as **proto** in modern engines). This prototype is a reference to another object from which it inherits properties and methods.

Prototypes are key to achieving inheritance in JavaScript.

```javascript
const obj1 = {
    fname:"Divisht",
    lname:"K",
    greet:function (){
        return `Hey ${this.fname}` ;
    }
}


const obj2 = {
    fname:"Abhishek",
    lname:"P",
}

obj2.__proto__ = obj1;

console.log(obj2.greet())
```

### Dry run -

**Step 1: Call obj2.greet()**

• You call obj2.greet().

**Step 2: Lookup for greet**

• The JavaScript engine first checks if greet exists in obj2.

• It doesn’t, so it looks in **obj2.\_\_proto\_\_.**

• **obj2.\_\_proto\_\_** points to obj1, where the greet method is found.

**Step 3: Execution Context**

• The greet method from obj1 is executed. Inside the method:

• The value of this refers to obj2, because **obj2.greet()** is called.

• this.fname resolves to obj2.fname, which is “Abhishek”.

**Step 4: Return Value**

• The greet method returns the string:

```javascript
`Hey ${this.fname}` // Resolves to: "Hey Abhishek"
```

### Prototype chaining

> `In JavaScript, objects have a prototype property that enables inheritance. By setting obj2's prototype to obj1, obj2 can access obj1's methods. When calling a method like greet on obj2, JavaScript looks up the prototype chain to find the method in obj1 and uses properties from obj2 for execution, demonstrating how prototype chaining works.`
> 
> `obj2 -> obj1 -> Object.prototype -> null`

### Steps for prototype chaining.

1\. obj2.greet:

• Not found in obj2, so JavaScript checks **obj2.\_\_proto\_\_** (which is obj1).

• greet is found in obj1.

2\. this inside greet:

• Refers to the object that **called** the method (obj2 in this case).

## Function Prototypes

```javascript
Function.prototype.greet = function(){
    console.log(`Fun name is ${this.name}`)
}


function callProto(){}

callProto.greet();
```

The greet method is now available to all function objects because every function in JavaScript inherits from Function.prototype.

Here, you are adding a greet method to the Function.prototype.Now, every function in JavaScript inherits this greet method.  
**callProto** is a regular function like all functions, it inherits from Function.prototype.

### When we call greet()

• When you call **callProto.greet()**, JavaScript:

• Looks for greet on the **callProto** object itself (it’s not there).

• Then checks **callProto.\_\_proto\_\_,** which points to Function.prototype, where it finds greet.

### Notes -

1\. **Anonymous Functions**

If the function has no name (anonymous), the name property will be an empty string (""):

```javascript
const anonFunc = function() {};
anonFunc.greet(); // Output: Fun name is
```

**Custom Properties**

You can assign a custom name property:

```javascript
function customFunc() {}
customFunc.name = "My Custom Function";
customFunc.greet(); // Output: Fun name is My Custom Function
```

**Why Doesn’t It Work?**

• **Reason 1: Lack of a name property**

JavaScript assigns an empty string ("") to the name property of anonymous functions. So, when you call **anonFunc.greet()**, the greet method tries to use [this.name](http://this.name), which is "".

### Sol :

You can manually assign a name to the function:

```javascript
anonFunc.name = "Anonymous";
anonFunc.greet(); // Output: Fun name is Anonymous
```

2. ### Arrow Functions :
    
    An **arrow function** is a shorthand for writing functions and behaves differently than traditional functions.
    

```javascript
const arrowFunc = () => {};
arrowFunc.greet();
```

**Why Doesn’t It Work?**

• **Reason 1: No name property**

Arrow functions don’t have their own name property. Even if you assign a name:

```javascript
const arrowFunc = () => {};
console.log(arrowFunc.name); // Output: "" (empty string)
```

• **Reason 2: this in Arrow Functions**

Arrow functions don’t have their own this. Instead, they inherit this from the surrounding lexical scope.

When you call **arrowFunc.greet(),** this inside greet refers to the object where the greet function is defined (i.e., Function.prototype), **not the arrow function**.

### Sol :

Arrow functions inherently don’t work well in this scenario because they lack their own name property. You can wrap the arrow function in a named function if needed:

```javascript
const wrapper = function () {
  const arrowFunc = () => {};
  arrowFunc.name = "ArrowWrapped";
  return arrowFunc;
};

const myArrow = wrapper();
myArrow.greet(); // Output: Fun name is ArrowWrapped
```
